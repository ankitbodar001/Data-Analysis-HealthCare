# Health Monitoring Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of health monitoring data to uncover trends and insights into various health parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. The analysis utilizes Python libraries and data visualization techniques to identify patterns and support health decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values using median imputation for Body Temperature and Oxygen Saturation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed distributions and correlations among key health parameters like age, gender, heart rate, and activity levels.
- **Categorization**: Grouped individuals into categories based on age, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
- **Visualization**: Created insightful visualizations, including histograms, boxplots, and correlation matrices, for better data comprehension.
- **Actionable Insights**: Highlighted key findings such as age group distributions, gender-based metrics, and stress vs. sleep quality impacts on health.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Data Handling**: DataFrame operations, cleaning, and aggregation
- **Visualization**: Interactive and static plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- **Categorization**: Custom functions for classifying health metrics

## Key Insights

- Seniors represented the majority of the dataset, suggesting higher prevalence in that age group.
- Most individuals had normal heart rates and oxygen saturation levels.
- Elevated and Hypertension Stage 1 blood pressure was more common compared to severe hypertension.

## Instructions

1. Load the dataset in CSV format.
2. Ensure the required libraries (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`) are installed.
3. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis.
4. View the plots and summary statistics for actionable insights.
